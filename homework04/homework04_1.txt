Deep neural networks have been a major breakthrough in the world of computer science. These networks have allowed
amazing discoveries to occur with image and audio processing, as well as other interesting topics. However, while
deep learning is all the rage these days, I don't think it will stay that way. I think it will stick around and be
used when necessary, but I don't think that in 10 years every single data operation will involve deep learning, and
there are a couple reasons why I believe this.

My first reason for believing this is because of the complexity involved in setting up a deep neural network. The
network needs to have the right number of layers and hyperparameters, and fine tuning these details can take a lot of
effort (and therefore money) which isn't attractive to a lot of companies. Even if a company sets up a deep neural
network, they still have to train this network which is my next reason. Training these networks can take multiple
weeks and require a ton of processing power. Whereas if the company sticks with a traditional machine learning model
they can quickly run it on a laptop. My final reason involves the applicability of deep neural networks. In a lot of
business problems, basic machine learning works just fine because the company has access to high quality business data.
Therefore, it would be overkill to apply deep learning to these situations. Rather, deep neural networks will have a
bigger influence in the areas of lower quality data like images and audio. So, I think deep neural networks will be
used in the future, but rather than being on the top of the mountain I think they will be used alongside of machine
learning.
