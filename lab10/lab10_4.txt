Exercise 10.4

a.
i. The size of the cats and dogs data sets are each 1000 training images and 500 testing images. All of these images
have the shape 150x150 each with 3 color channels R,G,B.

ii. The first CNN is very similar to the one built in class, with only small differences. The first small difference
is that this CNN has a 3rd maxpooling after the 3rd conv2D before 2 fully connected layers, whereas our CNN did not
have this and went straight from the 3rd conv2D to the 2 fully connected layers. Another difference is that this CNN
applies the convolution filters 16, 32, and 64, whereas our CNN applied the filters 32, 32, and 64. Also, this CNN
uses fully connected layers with 512 and 1 units, while our CNN used these layers with 64 and 10 units. Lastly, this
CNN uses the sigmoid activation function on the output later while our CNN used the softmax function.

iii. It's interesting that at the beginning of the process there are recognizable images, but by the time you get to
the bottom it's almost all teal with spots of yellow and basically no recognizable images. It is also interesting
that when either the input or maxpooling inputs to conv2D everything may shrink but stays aligned. However, when the
conv2D inputs to maxpooling it is both shrunk and misaligned.
