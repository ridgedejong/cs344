Exercise 10.1

a. I would much rather use Keras than Tensorflow to build my models. I feel that Keras is much more user friendly
and requires much less coding, while using more straightforward code.

b.
1. My best hyperparameters were learning_rate = 0.001, steps = 1000, batch_size = 200, and hidden_units = [10,2]. This
yielded a final RMSE of the training data = 105.35 and final RMSE of the validation data = 105.96.
2. Using these same hyperparameters on the test data, a final RMSE was found to be 103.68.
