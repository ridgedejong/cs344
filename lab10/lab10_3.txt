Exercise 10.3

a. The confusion matrix shows that the model is doing a good job at predicting what the actual value is, however it
also shows where the model mislabels things. The 3 highest probabilities of it mislabelling something is predicting a 9
when given a 4, predicting an 8 when given a 5, and predicting a 3 when given a 5.

b. The Tensorflow network architecture uses 2 hidden layers, each with 100 units. In comparison, our Keras network
from class used 1 hidden layer with 512 units. By setting the hyperparameters to learning_rate = 0.05, steps = 5000,
and batch_size = 100, I was able to get an accuracy on the test data of 0.96.

c. The visualizations for 10 steps are all pixelated with no form of pattern at all. However, after 1000 steps these
visualizations start to show clearer patterns with darker spots in some areas and lighter spots in others. Some even
resemble pieces of a number.
