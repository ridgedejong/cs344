Exercise 11.1

a. A linear model would be preferable if there was not a lot of data for the model. With small amounts of data a deep
NN could be overfit and end up as a worse solution than if a linear model was used. Another benefit to linear models
is that they train much quicker than DNNs because they have much less parameters and layers to deal with.

b. The NN model has a much better accuracy on the test set (0.88 vs 0.7852) and a much better average loss (0.3446 vs
0.4513), while the linear model has a slightly better precision than the NN (0.773 vs 0.75). So, overall I would say
the NN does a better job.

c. The embedding column doesn't do much good for the sentiment analysis. It makes the DNN worse and is similar to the
linear model. With embeddings the DNN has an accuracy of 0.7798, an average loss of 0.4574, and a precision of 0.777.

d. "fantastic" and "perfect" occur very close to each other in the embedding space. This makes sense because they are
both words that mean very good, so they can be used interchangeably in a sentence with almost the exact same meaning.
In the context of this data, it makes sense that if someone really loved a movie, they could use either one of these
words to describe how they felt about it.

e. I could not design a model that was better than Google's solution. The best I could do was the hyperparameters of
learning_rate = 0.12, clip_gradients_by_norm(my_optimizer, 2.0), and a hidden layer structure of [12,10]. This yielded
an accuracy of 0.7897, an average loss of 0.4500, and a precision of 0.762.
