Exercise 11.2

a. Men make up more than two-thirds of the data points, indicating bias in the data selection. Other bias comes from the
fact that white people make up almost all of the data, even though the United States is very diverse.

b. The Facets Dive shows that while married-civ-spouse is the biggest category, there are 5 times more men in this group
than women, indicating data collection bias against married women.

c. Some bias could come from that fact that only working people are included in this data. Bias definitely comes from
the fact that more men are included than women, even though the US is about 1:1. Capital gain / capital loss doesn't
vary a lot so it doesn't give much information. Age varies quite a bit so it should be bucketized to convey more
information and avoid overfitting.

d. When looking at the evaluation metrics of race, there are disparities that skew towards Asian-Pac-Islander and
White having the highest precision and recall. However, Asian-Pac-Islander also has the highest false positive rate and
White has the second highest. Amer-Indian-Eskimo and Black both have a slightly lower precision and a bit lower recall.
Other has a precision similar to the first 2 but by far the worst recall. But these last 3 have much lower false
positive rates than the first 2.
