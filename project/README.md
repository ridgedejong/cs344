Final Project: Deep Dream  
Ridge DeJong  
CS 344

The goal of this project was to use the Deep Dream algorithm to 
better understand how neural networks see images and interact with 
different types of images.

"Deep Dream Code" shows the full code of this project.

"Report" explains the main components of this program, along
with the tests performed and overall results and implications.

To run the code, all you have to do is make sure the image you
want to analyze is included in your directory. Then, you can
change the output of the image based on the different layer
activation coefficients and hyperparameters, which are both 
explained in "Report".
