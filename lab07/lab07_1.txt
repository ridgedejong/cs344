Exercise 7.1

a.
    1. cities["Named after Saint & Area greater than 50 sq mi"] = (cities["City name"].apply(lambda name: name.startswith('San')) & (cities['Area square miles'] > 50))
       cities
    2. cities.reindex([0,3,1,2])
b. Pandas allows you to have different data types for each column instead of each array like Numpy, creating much
more flexibility and opportunity for whatever array you might need.
c. It would be useful to shuffle a Pandas dataframe if this data needed to be split into training and testing sets.
By shuffling before splitting, it would reduce the chance that you accidentally put all of one type of data in the
training set and all of another type of data in the test set.
